# credit card fraud detection using machine learning.

This repository contains the code written in python to Identify fraudulent credit card transactions.

as the dataset is highly imbalanced i have used under-sampling and over-sampling methods to create a better machine learning model.

i have used Logistic Regression as the machine learning model and the performance of the model is quite up to the mark.

this dataset is taken from kaggle you can go through this link https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud for the dataset and for the complete elaboration of the problem statement.

here you can find my work on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/iamsiddhant/credit-card-fraud-detection-and-data-imbalance
